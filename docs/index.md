# novelyst_timeline

The [novelyst](https://peter88213.github.io/novelyst/) Python program helps authors organize novels.  

The *novelyst_timeline* plugin synchronizes novelyst projects with [Timeline](http://thetimelineproj.sourceforge.net/).

## Features

- Generate a *Timeline* project from a *novelyst* project.
- Synchronize *novelyst* scenes with corresponding *Timeline* events in both directions.
- When synchronizing a novelyst project with a timeline, optionally change unspecific scene "Day/Hour/Minute" to specific "date/time" and vice versa.

## Requirements

- [Timeline 2.4+](https://sourceforge.net/projects/thetimelineproj/). Versions below 2.4 do not support labels, which are necessary for synchronization with yWriter.
- [novelyst](https://peter88213.github.io/novelyst/) version 4.0+


## Download and install

[Download the latest release (version 4.1.0)](https://github.com/peter88213/novelyst_timeline/raw/main/dist/novelyst_timeline_v4.1.0.zip)

- Extract the "novelyst_timeline_v4.1.0" folder from the downloaded zipfile "novelyst_timeline_v4.1.0.zip".
- Move into this new folder and launch **setup.pyw**. This installs the plugin for the local user.
