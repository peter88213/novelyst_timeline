# noveltree_timeline

The [noveltree](https://peter88213.github.io/noveltree/) Python program helps authors organize novels.  

The *noveltree_timeline* plugin synchronizes noveltree projects with [Timeline](http://thetimelineproj.sourceforge.net/).

## Features

- Generate a *Timeline* project from a *noveltree* project.
- Synchronize *noveltree* sections with corresponding *Timeline* events in both directions.
- When synchronizing a noveltree project with a timeline, optionally change unspecific section "Day/Hour/Minute" to specific "date/time" and vice versa.

## Requirements

- [Timeline 2.4+](https://sourceforge.net/projects/thetimelineproj/). Versions below 2.4 do not support labels, which are necessary for synchronization with yWriter.
- [noveltree](https://peter88213.github.io/noveltree/) version 1.0+


## Download and install

[Download the latest release (version 0.99.0)](https://github.com/peter88213/noveltree_timeline/raw/main/dist/noveltree_timeline_v0.99.0.zip)

- Extract the "noveltree_timeline_v0.99.0" folder from the downloaded zipfile "noveltree_timeline_v0.99.0.zip".
- Move into this new folder and launch **setup.pyw**. This installs the plugin for the local user.
