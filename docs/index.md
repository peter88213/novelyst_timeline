# noveltree_timeline

The [noveltree](https://peter88213.github.io/noveltree/) Python program helps authors organize novels.  

The *noveltree_timeline* plugin synchronizes noveltree projects with [Timeline](http://thetimelineproj.sourceforge.net/).

## Features

- Create a timeline from a *noveltree* project.
- Create a new *noveltree* project from a timeline.
- Synchronize *noveltree* sections with corresponding timeline events in both directions.


## Requirements

- [Timeline 2.4+](https://sourceforge.net/projects/thetimelineproj/). Versions below 2.4 do not support labels, which are necessary for synchronization with yWriter.
- [noveltree](https://peter88213.github.io/noveltree/) version 1.0+


## Download and install
